• Helper application for Programming Language Concept class.</br>
• The program opens PDFs from the class notes.</br>
• IMPORTANT! Extract the files out before running the jar file. Running the file inside of the archive sometimes causes problems.</br>
• The executable jar file is in the "dist" folder. You'll need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 to execute it.</br>
• Good luck in PLC.
